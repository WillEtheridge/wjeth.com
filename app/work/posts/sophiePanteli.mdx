# Sophie Panteli

##### Portfolio Site

### TLDR

SophiePanteli.com is a portfolio site built for animator and illustrator Sophie Panteli
<br/>

### Context

**Client / Project Type**: Freelance Work
<br/>
Sophie approached me to build her a professional website to showcase her animation work.
<br/>
I built her a responsive site using NextJS so she could showcase her work.
<br/>

### Implementation

Sophie's website is built using NextJS. It makes use of multiple media types including video, images, and Rive animations.

<br/>
<br/>


### Challenges & Solutions

The core challenge for this project was designing a layout and user experience that showcased Sophie's work in a high quality way. After some iteration, I settled on a layout of card components which would demonstrate her portfolio.
<br/>
On click, the card components open a modal which displays the relevant piece of work. Again, a challenge here was in designing a layout which displayed both image carousels and videos in a high quality way on all devices.

<br/>

### Reflection

A key learning in this project was for me to focus on designing in an iterative way and to keep "working in" to a design until I am really happy with it.
<br/>
Broadly, this was quite a simple project to complete from a technical point of view which gave me lots of time to focus on creating a smooth user experience and allowing the site to "get out of the way" and really allow the quality of the work to shine through.
