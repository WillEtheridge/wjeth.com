# Origin Thread

##### Blockchain Backed Block Print

### TLDR

Origin Thread is a clothing brand that uses NFTs to explore transparency in fashion supply chains. The brand produced a range of men's shirts, hand printed using a centuries old technique in Rajasthan, India.
<br/>
Each shirt included an NFC chip that linked to an NFT. The NFT contained a video of the products production as well as complete records of all the suppliers used to create the product.
<br/>

### Context

**Client / Project Type**: Freelance / Startup
<br/>
This project had it's roots in my early 20s when I worked as a teacher in India for a year. During this time, I fell in love with the traditional Indian textile technique of block printing.
<br/>
During COVID, I began exploring the blockchain and considering how it's combination of permanency and public transparency could be used in more traditional industries.  
<br/>
I realised that the fashion industry is notorious for its lack of transparency. I conceived of the idea of using NFTs as a permanent and public record of a product's supply chain information, and Origin Thread was born.

### Implementation

To create Origin Thread, I needed to travel to India to meet with suppliers during 2021. As the COVID crisis was ongoing, this required me to isolate in a Calcutta hotel on arrival which was an interesting experience!
<br/>
One of the key focus points of the brand was creating a transparent supply chain. I met with suppliers which shared a similar ethos in India to provide we with fabric as well as the incredibly talented textile artisan, Dheeraj Chippa in Bagru to print my fabric.
<br/>
I travelled to India again to create a film of the printing process for the fabric used, this was then displayed on each product's NFT which was accessible by scanning an NFC chip embedded in the shirt. Cut and sew for the garments was handled in London.
<br/>
I wanted Origin Thread to be a blockchain first brand, so purchasing of the products was done on-chain by purchasing an NFT. With the help of the incredibly patient "DR" I then built an NFT claim mechanism where the NFTs where used to claim delivery of the matching product.

### Challenges & Solutions

The main challenges for me with this work were less technical and more supplier management based. Initially, I found it very challenging to find skilled partners for pattern cutting in the UK.
<br/>
These challenges were solved with persistence and an underlying drive to create the highest quality product I possibly could.
<br/>
Unlike software or media, the iteration time for physical products is much longer. This lead to delays in production and is something I will be mindful of if making products in the physical world again.
<br/>
Physical businesses are also much harder to scale without access to capital. They involve a large amount of funds tied up in stock, which you have to sell to have more money to turn into stock to crank the handle of growth.

### Outcome / Results

Origin Thread opened a lot of doors for me. It lead to speaking opportunities at Oxford University, NFT NYC and NFT NYC London.
<br/>
My work with Origin Thread lead to a project with the innovative UK based furniture startup Gather Design which I will be able to speak about soon!
<br/>

### Reflection

Making physical products is hard!
<br/>
Whilst ultimately Origin Thread was not a commerical success at this time, my continued travels around the world and exposure to its heritage of craft textile processes has kept the embers of this idea burning. In the near future, I hope to return to it
