# Mushroom Rise

##### Batch Tracking App

### TLDR

A simple batch tracking web experience built for customers of Mushroom Rise to explore the provenance and benefits of their purchase.
<br/>

### Context

**Client / Project Type**: Freelance Work
<br/>
Alex, the owner of Mushroom Rise approached me to build a batch tracking app for his range of medicinal mushroom products.
<br/>

### Implementation

The batch tracking app is built using NextJS and allows for the team to easily add new batches with a unique link which can then be converted into QR codes and added to Mushroom Rise product packs.
<br/>

### Challenges & Solutions

A key requirement for this project was to make a great mobile first experience for users. To do this, I paid close attention to the design of the page users would land on as well as making use of NextJS's inbuilt image optimization features.
