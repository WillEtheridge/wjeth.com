# Fliq

##### Get Smarter by Scrolling

### TLDR

Fliq is a mobile app which lets users explore their interests through microlearning. The app borrows the "scroll" feature that is so popular on social apps and uses it to engage users to learn rather than waste their time.
<br/>

### Context

**Client / Project Type**: Startup
<br/>
Fliq was inspired by two things. Firstly, my love of using LLMs to learn about the world. Secondly, by a desire to create an alternative to "scrolling" on social media that is helpful to the user rather than harmful to them.
<br/>

### Implementation

Fliq is built using React Native with an Express JS backend and MongoDB for the database.
<br/>
The facts, known in the app as "fliqs" and in-depth topics known as scrolls were generated using an LLM.
<br/>
To batch generate this content I made use of Groqs batch job feature. This allowed me to create 10s of thousands of facts and short lessons at a very low cost.
<br/>

### Challenges & Solutions

The ongoing challenge for me with this app is - How can I create a learning experience that is as enjoyable as scrolling on social apps? I'm still trying to figure this out!
<br/>

### Reflection

Launching a mobile app is the easy part, iterating to the point where it is successful is more difficult.
<br/>
