# Studio Bagru

##### Messaging Makeover and Site Redesign

### TLDR

Studio Bagru is a successful and fast growing textile sourcing and tourism business based just outside of Jaipur, Rajasthan.
<br/>
They needed help with clarifying their messaging to make it easier for potential customers as well as adding additional services to their range.
<br/>
I worked with them to refine their copy across the site before rebuilding it using Strikingly.

### Context

**Client / Project Type**: Freelance
<br/>
I've known Jeremy, the founder of Studio Bagru since my time in India in my early 20s. I was fortunate to be present at the inauguration puja (a traditional ceremonial blessing for prosperity and success) when the business first launched.
<br/>
Jeremy was looking for some help refreshing the messaging and design on the Studio Bagru from someone who was familiar with the business but at arm's reach enough to have a fresh perspective so brought me onboard.

### Implementation

The existing SB website was built using Strikingly and Jeremy was keen to continue using this so all development work was done there.
<br/>
The key part of my task was to restructure the copy and the site layout to effectively deal with the different kinds of customers the business would serve.
